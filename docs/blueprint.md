# **App Name**: Calc-U-Later

## Core Features:

- Basic Calculator UI: A simple calculator interface mimicking a standard handheld calculator, with buttons for digits (0-9), basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), equals (=), and clear (C).
- Dynamic Display: Display screen to show input, the ongoing operation, and the result. The display updates dynamically as the user interacts with the calculator.
- Real-Time Calculation: Real-time calculation, automatically performing the selected operation and displaying result upon pressing '='. Error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs.
- Order of Operations: Order of Operations follows mathematical conventions by giving multiplication and division precedence over addition and subtraction.
- Memory Functions: Memory functions allow the user to store, recall, add to, and subtract from a memory location. Buttons for MC (Memory Clear), MR (Memory Recall), M+ (Memory Add), M- (Memory Subtract), and MS (Memory Store).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated blue (#6699CC) for the buttons, evoking a sense of reliability and calm.
- Background color: A light grey (#F0F0F0) background to provide a neutral and clean setting that enhances readability and focuses user attention on the calculator interface.
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#FFA500) for the '=' button to draw attention to the most important action.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for both display and buttons to maintain clarity and modernity.
- Simple, clear symbols for operations (+, -, *, /) and memory functions.
- Standard calculator layout for ease of use and familiarity.
- Subtle button press animations to give tactile feedback.
